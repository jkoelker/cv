Hi Google,

I would be honored if you would review my application/resume for your Unix Systems Admin position.  For many years now, I have been a loyal follower of the Google, and am fascinated by all the cool stuff you all come up with and get to implement to make the Internet a better place for all.  I want to do that!  I am an experience Unix/Linux admin who has been fortunate enough to work in pretty much all facets of systems admin.  From hardware tech to software tech, from backup architect to network architect, I've done a bit of everything.

I have been running Unix/Linux systems for about 6 years now, started out as a hobby to "learn more about how computers work" and eventually lead to tinkering around every waking minute.  At Rackspace, I have really honed my systems admin skills.  Starting off in the data center and working my way through support, managed backup, and now programming, I have become one of a hand full "GOTO" guys when things head south and we need to take control of an issue and get it fixed with a quickness.

As I'm sure you will conclude from reading my resume, I believe I am a perfect match for your Google.com team.

Happy Hacking!
